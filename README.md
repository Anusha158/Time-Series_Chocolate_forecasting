#  Time Series Forecasting with SARIMA

This project focuses on building a **SARIMA** (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting, supported by exploratory and statistical analysis techniques.


---

##  Key Features

-  Developed a robust **SARIMA-based** forecasting model for time series data
-  Created **baseline forecasts** using **Linear Regression** for comparison
-  Performed **time series decomposition** to separate trend, seasonality, and residual components
-  Applied **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)** test to verify **stationarity**
-  Used **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)** to select optimal SARIMA parameters
-  Conducted **residual diagnostics** to validate model assumptions and performance
